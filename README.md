This repository contains my submission to the [Deloitte STEM Virtual Program](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/YPWCiGNTkr6QxcpEu/Deloitte-STEM-Virtual-Experience-Program). This program has been designed help you build your skills and confidence to pursue a career in STEM. It’s a great chance to uncover the exciting opportunities at Deloitte!

**Task 1. Coding**

Daikibo Industrials is a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. It is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure user devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two. My task is to build the data unification algorithm that combines two data models. Working on this task you I gained practical skills in programming with Python and data structures.

**Task 2. Data Analysis**

Having the data unification algorithm built, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

  - Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
  - Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
  - Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
  - Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
1.	In which location did machines break the most?
2.	What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

Second task is to manipulate, analyze and visualize  all telemetry data with Tableau to deliver isignts that will help in answering client's questions. Working on this task I gained practical skills with data modeling, data analysis and visualisations with Tableau of telemetry data.

**Task 3. Development**

Third task is focused on writing a formal & informative, but short development proposal for the following project: 
  
  - Private dashboard with health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories, for which they collect telemetry.
  - Access to the page happens only within client's Intranet.
  - Authentication is synced to internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).
  - The dashboard consists of a single page, listing the current statuses of all monitored devices.
  - The view is collapsible/expandable at a factory level, as well as device level (showing history of statuses). 

What to include in the developmental proposal:

**1. Overview**
  - An intro to the proposal and a high-level description of the project

**2.	Scope**
  - Describe the functionality of the project
  - Reference the graphics included in the template

**3.	Estimate**
  - A total man-hour estimate + breakdown for Development, Testing, and Integration

**4.	Timeline**
  - List the milestones of the project

**5.	Support**
  - Let the client know they can rely on continuous product support (bug fixes, support tickets, new functionality)

Writing a software development proposal helped me to gain practical skills in planning, formal communication and software development process.

**Task 4. Cyber Security**

A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information of Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached. The task to resolve is to identify the security issue which led to a leak of private company information. Working on this taks helped me gain pratical skills in log inspection, computer networks and web security.

**Task 5. Forensic Technology**

After a worrisome number of internal complaints on gender inequality (in terms of pay), Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate.
The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most/all job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it will be a great welcoming task for me to finish the job. While working on investigation into unfair pay I gained practical skills with digital spreadsheets.
