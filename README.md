**Task 1. Coding**

Daikibo Industrials is a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. It is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure user devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two. My task is to build the data unification algorithm that combines two data models. Working on this task you I gained practical skills in programming with Python and data structures.

**Task 2. Data Analysis**

Having the data unification algorithm built, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

  - Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
  - Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
  - Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
  -Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
1.	In which location did machines break the most?
2.	What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

Second task is to manipulate, analyze and visualize  all telemetry data with Tableau to deliver isignts that will help in answering client's questions.
