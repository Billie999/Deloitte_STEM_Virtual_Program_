**Task 1. Coding**

Daikibo Industrials is a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. It is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure user devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two. My task is to build the data unification algorithm that combines two data models. Working on this task you I gained practical skills in programming with Python and data structures.
